            <p id="p1">You probably know that exercising at moderate intensity for 20 minutes elevates your mood for up
                to 12 hours. That exercise increases the production of a protein that supports the function, growth, and
                survival of brain cells. That exercise is one of the five daily habits a 30-year Harvard study shows can
                not only increase your lifespan by 12 to 14 years but also cut your risk of Alzheimer's in half.

                And, of particular interest during times like these, that exercise helps you better manage stress.

                But when you feel overworked, overwhelmed, and struggling to make sense of the new normal, it's tough to
                exercise regularly -- much less reap the benefits. <br>
                Science to the rescue <br>

                According to a study published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, one 23-minute HIIT session
                per week can boost aerobic capacity, lower blood pressure, and lower body fat...and one session is
                nearly as effective as doing three 23-minute sessions per week.


                Researchers created three groups. One did an HIIT workout three times a week, another did one HIIT
                workout per week, the third did three moderate-intensity workouts per week, and the fourth group did
                nothing. (I've been a part of a few research studies and never got to be in the "do nothing" group.)

                Both of the HIIT workout groups lost more body fat than the other two groups, but the one time per week
                group lost nearly as much -- and also reaped similar aerobic and blood pressure benefits.

                Still, there's one major caveat: You can't just spin lightly on an exercise bike. You can't just breeze
                along on the elliptical. You can't just knock out 12 reps of dumbbell bicep curls with a five-pound
                weight while you check your email with your free hand.

                Your HIIT workout has to be a true HIIT workout.

                HIIT stands for High-Intensity Interval Training. The principle is simple. You go almost as hard as you
                can for a short period of time, then "rest" for enough time to let you recover enough to go hard again.

                In running terms, that could mean sprinting for 30 seconds, jogging for 30 seconds, sprinting for
                another 30 seconds, etc. Here are plenty of different HIIT options, some aerobic, others
                strength-focused.</p>

            <h2> The Effects of Exercise on Muscles</h2><br>
            Exercise involves a series of sustained muscle contractions, of either long or short duration, depending on
            the nature of the physical activity. Effects of exercise on muscles can be considered short-term or
            immediate, both during and shortly after exercise; as well as long-term, lasting effects.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Short-Term Effects</b></h3><br>
            The effects of exercise on muscles varies with the type and duration of the activity.Aerobic exercise is
            typical of activities requiring endurance and sustained muscle contractions. Such activities rely mainly on
            Type I (slow-twitch muscles) which sustain maximal contraction for extensive periods of time. This use of
            slow-twitch muscles, and the availability of oxygen, prevents the buildup of lactic acid, and typically does
            not result in substantial muscle fatigue in the short-term. Sustained aerobic respiration tends to shift the
            metabolic pathways of muscle to favor the use of fat as the primary source of ATP, and glycogen is generally
            avoided.
            <br> <br>
            Anaerobic respiration, typical of sprinting and weight lifting , prioritizes the use of Type II
            (fast-twitch) muscles fibers for short, high-intensity contractions. Muscles prioritize the use of
            readily-available ATP, glucose and glycogen for these contractions, which results in a build-up of lactic
            acid. Though traditionally viewed as the cause of muscle fatigue, recent research indicates ion shortages,
            particularly of calcium, during an aerobic exercise, causes such muscle fatigue. However, lactic acid
            inhibits further ATP production, indirectly causing fatigue.
            Muscle soreness, once thought to be due to lactic acid accumulation, has more recently been attributed to
            small tearing of the muscles fibers caused by eccentric contraction.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Long-Term Effects</b></h3><br>
            Muscle hypertrophy, or the increase in muscle mass due to exercise , particularly weight training, is a
            noticeable long-term effect of exercise. Exercise of specific muscles can often result in hypertrophy in the
            opposite muscles as well, a phenomenon known as cross education.
            <br><br>
            Experts and professionals differ widely on the best approaches to specifically achieve muscle growth, as
            opposed to focusing on gaining strength, power, or endurance. It was generally considered that consistent
            anaerobic strength training will produce hypertrophy over the long term, in addition to its effects on
            muscular strength and endurance.</p>
